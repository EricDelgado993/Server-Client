<b>Client-Server Communication Program</b>
<br>This program establishes a basic client-server architecture, enabling two-way communication between the server and multiple clients. The server listens for incoming client connections and responds to various client requests, allowing for real-time data exchange and controlled interactions. Ideal for demonstrating the fundamentals of networking and socket programming.
